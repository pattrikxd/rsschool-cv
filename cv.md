### I have a great desire to change my profession to a programmer. I graduated from the university and work at a Kommunarka factory by profession as an electronic engineer. the first year it was interesting to work, because I did not know what and how it works. but after you know all the product lines you hit the ceiling, there is nowhere to grow further. all the times when I met with programming in education, it was very easy, so I decided to change my profession to a programmer. programming opens many doors, such as international companies.
### programming skills in html css js languages are only basic. I've read the documentation myself and figured it out.
```function orderWeight(strng) {
   return strng.split(' ').sort(function compare(a, b) {
      let result = a.split('').reduce((sum, item) => sum + +item, 0) - b.split('').reduce((sum, item) => sum + +item, 0);

      return result != 0 ? result : a > b ? 1 : a < b ? -1 : 0;


   }).join(' ');

   // yougitr code
}
```
